In order to make this project truly 'headless' one must first be able to access the command line immeadiately following startup.  We don't want to have to log in first.

To set up auto-login in Raspbian: 
(from http://raspisimon.no-ip.org/rpi_autologin.php)

Auto Login: 
1) Edit /etc/inittab 
	sudo nano /etc/inittab
2) Scroll down to: 
	1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 115200 tty1
3) Change to 
	#1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 115200 tty1
4) Under that line add:
	1:2345:respawn:/bin/login -f pi tty1 </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1
5) Save the file and exit, (ctrl + o to save and ctrl + x to exit) 

Upon restart, the Pi will boot automatically to the Command line.
