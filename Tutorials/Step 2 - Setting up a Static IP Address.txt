For this project, it's helpful to have a static IP address.  Normall, the Raspberry Pi is assigned an IP address automatically each time the Pi is turned on.  This address is not random, but it is not usually the same more than once.  In order to make this project truly headless, it is important to be sure of the IP address assigned to the Pi in order to utilize SSH.

To Set up Static IP 
(From https://www.modmypi.com/blog/tutorial-how-to-give-your-raspberry-pi-a-static-ip-address)

A. Checking Set Up
 
Boot into Raspian and log in (Username. pi, Password. raspberry), this will all be command line stuff, so no need to log in to the GUI.
 
First, we need to list the network interface we currently have available:
 
cat /etc/network/interfaces
 
 
The line . . . . 
 
iface eth0 inet dhcp
 
Implies that we're currently getting out IP address via DHCP, meaning it's being dynamically registered by the router. This is what we want to change!
 
B. Gathering Information
 
Fist of all we need to grab some information from our router and Pi. There's a couple of command we need to run to get this info. Have a pen and paper handy! . . . 
 
ifconfig
 

This reveals your router information, the bit you want is after eth0 (the ethernet connection). . . .
 
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr b8:27:eb:b3:fc:2c
               inet addr:192.168.1.81  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
 
Write down the following information. . .
 
inet addr – 192.168.1.81 (Pi's Current IP Address)
Bcast –  192.168.1.255 (The Broadcast IP Range)
Mask –  255.255.255.0 (Subnet Mask Address)
 
We need a little more information before we proceed. Use the command. . . 
 
netstat -nr
(route -n will give you the same info.)
 
We need:
 
'Gateway' Address – 192.168.1.254
'Destination' Address – 192.168.1.0
 
C. Editing Network Configuration
 
We now need to plug this information into the Pi's network configuration file using a text editor. I always use nano text editor. . . 
 
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
  
Simply change the line that reads:
 
iface eth0 inet dhcp
 
to
 
iface eth0 inet static
 
Then directly below this line enter the following (Please Note. You will need your own addresses we gathered in Part B, more details below). . . . 
 
address 192.168.1.81
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.1.0
broadcast 192.168.1.255
gateway 192.168.1.254
 
To clarify what each part means. . . . 
 
address – The address you want to give your Pi, this can be any IP in the network range, but it's usually advisable to go higher rather than lower, or you could end up logging different devices to the same IP! I've selected 192.168.1.81, as we're already registered to that address (denoted by 'inet addr'), but this can be any IP address from the range192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.255.
 
netmask – The 'Mask' address we wrote down earlier.
 
network – The router IP address, this is the 'Destination' Address was found earlier. You can also grab this off your router, it will say on the side somewhere.
 
broadcast – The 'Bcast' address we wrote down earlier. 
 
gateway – This is the 'Gateway' address we found earlier.
 

 
So, it should look something like the above, but with your values! Remember to save before exit, CTRL+X (exit) then yes to save changes!
 
D. Re-check Static IP Configuration
 
Then we'll need to reboot and check your changes. . . 
 
sudo reboot
 
Log back in and run 
 
ifconfig
 
Which should reveal your new settings. . 
 

 
To double check all is working as it should, ping your 'Gateway' Address. . . 
 
ping 192.168.1.254 -c 10
 
(the -c 10 command simply denotes that you want to ping it 10 times, if you forget to add this, it will ping the address continuosly. To stop it press CTRL+C)
 
 
This should ping successfully and all packets should be recieved. If something's not right double check through all your IP addresses, and make sure you're pinging the right address too. Remember you can always revert back to DHCP by reversing the steps. The 'network' router IP address is sometimes a little fiddly, so check that if you're still having issues!
 
Hopefully however, your Raspberry Pi is now set up with a static IP address!
