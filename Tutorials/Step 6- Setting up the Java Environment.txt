With the program suite installed on the Pi, it is now time to setup the Java environment on the Pi.

- Ensure that you have a Java Runtime Environment installed.

- If not, download and install the latest JRE (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jre-7-download-432155.html)

- Download Eclipse JAVA IDE.

- To work with the Leap Motion and my program with Eclipse, follow the "Leap Sample in Java" document in the "Tutorials" section of the repo.

- When building the datapath of the project, you must also add the "jsch-0.1.50.jar" file.  This is the JSch module and is necessary to the project.

- When the project has been set up, add the "FinalDraft.java" file to the source file of the project.  This is the final working copy of the program.

- Try running the program!
