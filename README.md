This repository contains all files related to my Leap Motion project.

It includes everything from materials and tutorials to troubleshooting the issues I've had so far.
It's still a work in progress...

Assumptions made for this project:

1. A working knowledge of computers as well as C and Java programming languages.

2. A Rasperry Pi with Raspbian OS installed.

3. Some understanding of working with the Linux command line.
