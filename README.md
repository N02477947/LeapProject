This repository contains all files related to my Leap Motion project.

It includes everything from materials and tutorials to troubleshooting the issues I've had.

Purpose of this Project

 - The aim of this project is to create a program that allows for the control of an RGB LED using only hand gestures.

 - I utilized the Leap Motion motion controller and a Raspberry Pi connected to an RGB LED and a suite of scripts and programs to achieve this.

Assumptions made for this project:

1. A working knowledge of computers as well as C and Java programming languages.

2. A Rasperry Pi with Raspbian OS installed.

3. Some understanding of working with the Linux command line.

4. Knowledge of how a breadboard works and minimal electronics backgound.

5. Patience. Lots of patience.
